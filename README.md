# mmmv_userspace_distro_t1

mmmv_userspace_distro_t1 is a set of code templates, Linux/BSD
specific Bash scripts, Bash aliases, Ruby scripts and relatively small
utility programs implemented in various programming languages. The
mmmv_userspace_distro_t1 can be seen as a reusable part of a development
environment setup. The mmmv_userspace_distro_t1 emerged from a repeated
creation of various virtual appliances, the creation of various memory
card images for Raspberry_Pi-s and repeated installation of Linux and
BSD operating systems to various computers. Installation and usage
details of the mmmv_userspace_distro_t1 are at

    ./home_folder_of_user_named_mmmv/COMMENTS.txt

The set of software packages at the 

    ./home_folder_of_user_named_mmmv/applications

can be increased by adding software packages from a project named
mmmv_userspace_distro_t1_pkg01, which is probably hosted at the
same code hosting service where the mmmv_userspace_distro_t1
is hosted. Milestone releases that include all of the software
packages from both, the mmmv_userspace_distro_t1 and the
mmmv_userspace_distro_t1_pkg01, MIGHT be downloaded from

    https://sourceforge.net/projects/mmmv-userspace-distro-t1/files/milestone_releases/

The planned release cycle for milestone releases of this project is
about 2 years. Thank You for studying this project.


## WARNING

Backwards compatibility of this project with its earlier versions 

    IS NOT EVEN A GOAL. 

Versions of the mmmv_userspace_distro_t1 are meant to be compatible only
with their own era mmmv_userspace_distro_t1_pkg01 versions. There is an
aim to make this project usable on both, Linux and BSD, but as of 2024
proper testing in the form of daily use is done only on Linux.
