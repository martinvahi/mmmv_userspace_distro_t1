# mmmv_userspace_distro_t1

This is a crippled version of the mmmv_userspace_distro_t1, because otherwise 
it would be too big for code hosting sites like GitHub and SourceForge, but 
most of the functionality has been retained. Further details are at

    ./mmmv_userspace_distro_t1/COMMENTS.txt

The planned release cycle of this project is about 3 years.

Thank You for studying this project.
