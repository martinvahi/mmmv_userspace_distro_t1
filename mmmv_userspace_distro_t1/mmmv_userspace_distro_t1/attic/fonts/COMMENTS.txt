The 

    ./the_fonts

contain upstream originals of the

    ./../../mmmv/etc/_fonts

and the 

    ./../../mmmv/etc/_fonts

is a default target of a symlik

    ~/.fonts

in a situation, where the 

    ~/.fonts

has not been created manually. In the case of Linux 
the font files (.ttf, etc.) are read from 
Linux distribution standard fonts folder and the 

    ~/.fonts

The way to make the fonts available to the various
applications that use the fonts, is to execute

    # https://www.techrepublic.com/blog/linux-and-open-source/how-do-i-install-and-use-fonts-in-linux/
    # archival copy: https://archive.vn/UgphK
    fc-cache -f -v 

which MIGHT be defined by an alias

    mmmv_admin_refresh_fonts_cache_t1 # should work on both, Linux and BSD.
