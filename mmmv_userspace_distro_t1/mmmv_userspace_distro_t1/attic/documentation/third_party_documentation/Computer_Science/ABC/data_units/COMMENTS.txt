The 

    ./2021_xx_xx_IBM_Storage_Insights_Product_Manual.pdf

has been downloaded on 2021_09_03 from

    https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/SSQRB8/pdf/storage-insights-documentation.pdf
    https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/storage-insights?topic=overview-units-measurement-storage-data

The relevant chapter is titled "Units of measurement for storage data"
and it resides at PDF-file page #120, visual page #63.

The reason, why the whole product manual has been added here
in stead of just the relevant chapter is that 
as of 2021_09_03 I(Martin.Vahi@softf1.com) think that the IBM deserves 
a bit of advertisement for its nice chapter and that the product
manual might contain also other sections or chapters that
might be more general than an IBM product or 
there might be some other interesting examples or ideas 
in that product manual.
