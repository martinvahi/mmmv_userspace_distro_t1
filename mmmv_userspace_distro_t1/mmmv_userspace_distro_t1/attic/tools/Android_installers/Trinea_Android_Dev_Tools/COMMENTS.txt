The 

    (Tested to work on Android_7.)
    ./cn.trinea.android.developertools_636_apps.evozi.com.apk

is a advertisement ridden closed source software 
that as of 2022_09_13 has an upstream distribution URL of 

    https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cn.trinea.android.developertools&gl=US

Due to the Google aggressive spying/privacy_violation_efforts the 

    ./cn.trinea.android.developertools_636_apps.evozi.com.apk

has been downloaded through a 3. party download service

    https://apps.evozi.com/apk-downloader/

that as of 2022_09 seems to be set up by a Malaysian company.
The 3. party might have inserted its own malware to the installer, but 
in Android_7 it is possible to disable the application from Android 
settings after installing it and on Android_7 the application 
works fine without receiving any special access rights from the user. 
For example, it does not require any read-write access. 
(Not explicitly requiring access does not mean that 
some malware doesn't have the access.)
