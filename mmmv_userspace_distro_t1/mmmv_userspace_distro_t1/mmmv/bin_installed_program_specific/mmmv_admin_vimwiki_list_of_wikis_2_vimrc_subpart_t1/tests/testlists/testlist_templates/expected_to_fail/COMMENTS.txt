In testing mode a first occurrence of a nonconformance at a
list of wikis causes an exit with nonzero error code.
Therefore, nonconformance examples that reside
at some line after the first nonconformance example,
do not tested. That is to say, each file in this folder 
is expected to contain exactly one nonconformance example.
