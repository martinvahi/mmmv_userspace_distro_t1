Ruby version 2.4.0 had a change that the use of Fixnum and Bignum 
triggers a stderr printed warning message that says that 
they have been deprecated in favour of their parent class, Integer.
Ruby version 2.7.2 moves the warning message from stderr back to stdout.
Therefore, Ruby versions 2.4.x, 2.5.x and 2.6.x are the versons
for testing the code that tries to detect errors by monitoring stderr output.
