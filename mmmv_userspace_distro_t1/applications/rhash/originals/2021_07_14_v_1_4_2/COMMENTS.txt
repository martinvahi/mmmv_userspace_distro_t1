    ./rhash-1.4.2-src.tar.gz  # the upstream original, downloaded on 2021_12_23 from

has been tested on ("uname -a")

Linux hoidla01 4.19.0-10-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 4.19.132-1 (2020-07-24) x86_64 GNU/Linux

with the following build commands:

./configure --prefix=/home/mmmv/applications/rhash/v_1_4_2 --enable-gettext --enable-static --extra-cflags=" -march=native -ftree-vectorize -O3 "
make
make test
make install

The "--enable-static" is used to overcome the situation, where
the librhash from the operating system package collection was
loaded in stead of the newly built one. Part of the rhash runtime
error message: "incompatible librhash version is loaded".
