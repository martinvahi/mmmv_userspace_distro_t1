There is NO endorsement by the original authors for redistributing
those course materials here, but the materials have been available over
a decade at the home page of the professor that runs the course, 

    Ain Isotamm

and I(Martin.Vahi@softf1.com) am pretty sure that with proper academic
referencing he as an academic does not mind having a few 3. party
"backups" of his and his colleagues' work. You'll probably need a
separate license from him for any commercial use of his works.  The
works are in Estonian, but may be one day auto-translators become good
enough that it's not a problem for people, who do not speak Estonian.
