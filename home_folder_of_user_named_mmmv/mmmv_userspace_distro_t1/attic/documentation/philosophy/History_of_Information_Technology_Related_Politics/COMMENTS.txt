Political decisions, specially by Information Technology companies,
do influence design decisions in terms of which components
are chosen to be the dependencies of various projects.
Therefore the history of business decisions and 
ideological decisions of various companies and 
state actors (leaderships of different states/supermafias)
is part of a code comment that partly explains,
why one technical solution has been chosen over
some other technical solution.

The issues related to various "intellectual property" "rights"
(copyrights, patents) illustrates such cases 
spectacularly well, specially in terms of life-hours
destroyed/wasted. As of 2024_01_02 I(Martin.Vahi@softf1.com)
claim that

    N_sm --- life-hours destroyed by a serial murderer
    N_murdered_humans --- number of humans murdered by a serial murderer
    N_lifehours_destroyed_by_a_political_decision
    N_su --- number of software users
    N_sd --- number of software/hardware developers/engineers

    N_sm = ~100years * (365 days/year ) * (24 hours/day) * 
         * N_murdered_humans ~ 
         ~ (N_murdered_humans * 876*10^3) life-hours

    N_lifehours_destroyed_by_a_political_decision = 
        =  (N_sud * 2_hours_minimum) + (N_sd * 5_years_minimum) >
        >  (N_sud * 2) + (N_sd * 5*365*24) >=
        >= (N_sud * 2) + (N_sd * 43*10^3)

That is to say, in terms of life-hours destroyed, 
serial murderers can be more innocent than 
many corporate decisions, specially those
corporate decisions that somehow limit the 
reuse of design work that developers/engineers have done.

Why not just legalize the sales of human organs
combined with the kidnapping of the people, who 
are killed/ripped_of_their_organs, if it's OK to 
destroy/waste human life-hours in the name of 
some corporate profit? Or accept organ sales,
including such, where the "seller" dies, as
monetary compensation of damages at court cases? 
Surely many corporations can justify it with
some explanation that this "creates value" and
"helps the economy", specially if the people,
who are killed, dismantled, are relatively poor 
anyway and therefore do not spend much 
on various goods and services.

If that sounds too extreme, then how to explain
the morality of business models that do not 
work without the creation of various artificial 
barriers? Another wording of this same question is:
how to explain the morality of Copyright and
Patents, if development work can be
financed with business models that do not
restrict the free, license wise unlimited,
use of all knowledge and bitstreams of that
development work? Specially in technical fields
like hardware and software development?

As of 2023_01_02 I(Martin.Vahi@softf1.com) I adhere
to the requirements of the "intellectual property laws"
out of social pressure, specially when it comes to
my clients' projects, but in my own thoughts I think
that life is hard enough even without artificial barriers
to knowledge reuse and design work reuse and in my
opinion a moral business model by my very subjective standards
is such, where I help my clients to overcome
natural barriers in stead of erecting a barrier
myself and then charging for letting people 
through/across that artificial barrier that I self 
erected. For example, a shipping company that
asks ticket money for conveying people/goods
over a natural barrier is acting morally, but
if somebody creates an artificial border somewhere
and then starts to demand border crossing fees,
then that I find to be immoral. As of 2023_01_02
my policy is that my clients keep the copyrights
of their project specific code, but my own
projects, including the libraries that I use
for developing software for my clients, is under
BSD or MIT license or in public domain.
That's how I avoid raising artificial
barriers to knowledge reuse and/or to the reuse
of design bitstreams.
