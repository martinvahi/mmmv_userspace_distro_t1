The documentation in this folder is mostly about future development
ideas of the mmmv_userspace_distro_t1. It may also include incomplete
drafts of various documentation, including documentation of subprojects
that do not have any code. The documentation in this folder is
public, but it's meant to be read only by the initial author of the
mmmv_userspace_distro_t1, Martin.Vahi@softf1.com, so it is mostly in
Estonian.

This whole folder should be deleted from deployment copies of the
mmmv_userspace_distro_t1. As You currently are reading the content
of this folder, then please do not bother to read the rest of the
documentation in this folder.

Thank You for reading this COMMENTS.txt
