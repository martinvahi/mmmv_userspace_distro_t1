Thanks, Martin I have a better idea now of why you could be interested, and am
certainly sympathetic to your aims. Given that it has been 25 years since I've
looked at RIP or the companion library TurboC needed to compile it, I've gone
back and reread my web pages associated with them, as well as examined at the
code.

Regarding TurboC:  Unfortunately, RIP was originally written for the Borland C
compiler on Windows 95, and isn't compatible with gcc or clang or other modern
C compilers without the TurboC library.  And since TurboC isn't being
maintained, there's no guarantee it still works.  Indeed, trying it just now,
compilation of TurboC fails due to wrong assumptions about integer datatypes. 
TurboC can be reworked, I'm sure, though how long it would be before
additional rework, I can't say.  In other words, keeping TurboC operational
into the future may be a losing battle.  On the good side, I think (hope?)
that TurboC is needed primarily for displaying retrieved text, so perhaps it
could be eliminated entirely by deleting any of the code in RIP that displays
retrieved text.

But the problem I perceive with changing the license for RIP to LPGL is that
RIP is not actually a library. Creating RIP as a library would have made
sense, but 30 years ago when I wrote it for my own personal use, it's not
something I thought of.  Rather, RIP a stand-alone executable program that can
be used as-is or modified.  There's not actually any way to link a separate
program to it.  So GPL vs LGPL would seem to be a moot point.

I would suggest this:  There is good documentation at the top of the file
ripUnix/rip.c about everything having to do with formation of the indexes and
retrieval of information from them.   That documentation is all you really
need, because the actual code for implementing those ideas (as opposed to
displaying the browsing retrieved text) is pretty simple to reimplement
yourself to get past the limitations of my 1996 implementation.  And the
unlikely event there's any of my actual RIP code you'd like to reuse, *you can
regard this note as giving you absolute permission to freely use, modify, or
distribute RIP source code, without any restriction whatever, including
removal or change of the GPL licensing notice, with or without attributing any
credit to me*.

If that's not a good enough compromise for you, we can continue to discuss it.

Ron
