The core development file, the 

    ./mmmv_userspace_distro_t1_logo_development_version.svg

has been created with Inkscape. From that the

    ./mmmv_userspace_distro_t1_logo.svg

has been derived. The rest of the image files 
were derived from the  

    ./mmmv_userspace_distro_t1_logo.svg
    
by using Gimp.    

The colors of the logo are white(#ffffff)/transparent and 
dark marine-blue(#052e3f).
