The idea is that the Bash script 

    ./cron_job_01_initialisations_stage_2.bash

is executed only once per restart of the computer and the setup is 
portable across different Linux distributions.
The portable scheme is that there is ~1MiB sized RAM-partition 
and the root user runs a cron-job that executes 

    ./cron_job_01_initialisations_stage_1.bash

which checks, wheter a file exists at that RAM partition and 
if the file is missing, creates it and executes the aforementioned 

    ./cron_job_01_initialisations_stage_2.bash

The file at the RAM-partition is in a role of a flag and it
gets erased during shutdown, because RAM-partitions along with
all of their contents get destroyed during shutdown.
When the computer reboots, the 

    ./cron_job_01_initialisations_stage_1.bash

executes the 

    ./cron_job_01_initialisations_stage_2.bash

again.
