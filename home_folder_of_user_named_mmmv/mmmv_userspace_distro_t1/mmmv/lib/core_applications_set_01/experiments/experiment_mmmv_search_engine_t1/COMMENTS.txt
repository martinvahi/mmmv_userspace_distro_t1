===========================================================================

The mmmv_search_engine_t1 is a set of command line tools for creating
and using a search index of a local set of documents. Online use of
the mmmv_search_engine_t1 is meant to take place by using the RSS/Atom
model: blog publishers self publish the search index files of their blogs
and a separate sub-part of the mmmv_search_engine_t1 project is used for
making aggregate searches over many blogs or used for downloading the
search indices.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
            Current EXPERIMENTAL STATE of the project
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The set of tools in this project is too incomplete to make this project
usable in production. From search engine perspective there is a lack
of essential functionality, but the tools that are there, tend to be
complete enough to be used as fragments of the search engine. Which
fragments the final version of the search engine will consists of, is
subject to studying and experimentation. Not all command line tools in
this experiment will be part of the final version of the search engine.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                       Usage Instructions
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Usage instructions of individual command line programs in

    ./bin

can be displayed by executing

    ./bin/<name of the program> help
