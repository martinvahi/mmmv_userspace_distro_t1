    The ./2025_09_28_clone_of_Debian_branch_of_the_silversearcher-ag.zip
    has been obtained by downloading/cloning
    https://salsa.debian.org/debian/silversearcher-ag.git

    and then repacking it.

The motivation for recompiling it on Debian and debian derived systems
is to create a CPU specific binary by using the 

    export   CFLAGS=" -march=native -mtune=native -ftree-vectorize -O3 "
    export CXXFLAGS=" -march=native -mtune=native -ftree-vectorize -O3 "

The motivation for using the Debian branch in stead of using the
original author's 2025_09_28 newest release, the version 2.2.0, is that
the version 2.2.0 failed to build on Debian.
