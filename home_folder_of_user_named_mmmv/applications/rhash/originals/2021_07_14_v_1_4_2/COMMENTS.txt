Linux host 5.10.0-23-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 5.10.179-1 (2023-05-12) x86_64 GNU/Linux

with the following build commands:

./configure --prefix=/home/mmmv/applications/rhash/v_1_4_2 --enable-gettext --enable-static --extra-cflags=" $CFLAGS "
make
make test
make install

The "--enable-static" is used to overcome the situation, where
the librhash from the operating system package collection was
loaded in stead of the newly built one. Part of the rhash runtime
error message: "incompatible librhash version is loaded".
