Everything in here is nasty, derived from a quick and dirty hack that 
was written long time ago not even for reuse, but literally as a demo 
for a comment at a private email. But it works, so as long as one does 
not need to read hardly any of it, the software is not in any online 
system and the data set is small enough to cope with the inefficiencies...
