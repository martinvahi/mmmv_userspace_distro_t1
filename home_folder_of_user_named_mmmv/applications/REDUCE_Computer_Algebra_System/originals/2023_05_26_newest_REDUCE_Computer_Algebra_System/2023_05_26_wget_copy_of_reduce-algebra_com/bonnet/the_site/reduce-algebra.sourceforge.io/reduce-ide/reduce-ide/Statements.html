<span id="index-Operations-on-Statements"></span>

<p>The most basic facility provided by REDUCE mode is the ability to move
forwards and backwards by statements or expressions through a file of
REDUCE source code.  Moving by one statement means moving to the
beginning or end of the <em>logical</em> statement currently containing
(or respectively preceding or following) point, which may involve
skipping many actual statements that are contained within the current
statement.  In particular, as REDUCE mode looks for the beginning or
end of a statement it will skip complete compound or block statements
(<code>begin &hellip;  end</code>), group statements (<code>&lt;&lt; &hellip; &gt;&gt;</code>),
and bracketed expressions (<code>(&hellip;)</code>, <code>{&hellip;}</code> and
<code>[&hellip;]</code>, although square brackets are not normally used in
REDUCE).  Bracket skipping is controlled entirely by the Emacs syntax
table.
</p>
<p>Hence, &ldquo;statement&rdquo; in this manual will normally mean a complete
<em>logical statement</em>.  A syntax-directed editor clearly must perform
a limited amount of parsing, but it must be remembered that a
syntax-directed editor has the following important differences from a
normal parser, because their basic purposes are different:
</p>
<ul>
<li> A syntax-directed editor must be able to parse both forwards <em>and
backwards</em>.

</li><li> It will typically parse only locally for speed and must therefore parse
based on incomplete information.

</li><li> It is provided for the convenience of the user and therefore need not
obey precisely the full syntax of the language, provided it is
consistent and reliable.
</li></ul>

<p>In particular, the REDUCE-mode movement commands may fail if point is
within a comment or string, although they should skip complete
comments and strings.
</p>
<p>REDUCE mode considers REDUCE statements to be terminated by either of
the characters <code>;</code> or <code>$</code>.  It also considers statements
contained within any kind of brackets to be delimited by those
brackets, statements within compound or block statements (<code>begin
&hellip; end</code>) to be delimited by the <code>begin</code> and <code>end</code>
keywords, and statements within group statements (<code>&lt;&lt; &hellip;
&gt;&gt;</code>) to be delimited by the <code>&lt;&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;&gt;</code> tokens.  Commas
are not considered to delimited statements.
</p>
<p>More precisely, a statement is considered to begin at the first
non-white-space character following the previous statement terminator,
opening bracket, <code>begin</code> or <code>&lt;&lt;</code>.  It is considered to end
immediately after the first statement terminator or immediately after
the last non-white-space character preceding a closing bracket,
<code>end</code> or <code>&gt;&gt;</code>.  Comments are treated as white space by all
REDUCE-mode commands other than those specifically related to
comments; <a href="Comments.html">Support for REDUCE comments</a>.
</p>
<p>The current philosophy of REDUCE mode is that the statements within a
compound or group statement form an essentially isolated system, and
that the basic statement-oriented commands should not move point
either into or out of this system, for which separate commands are
provided.  However, if you try hard enough, REDUCE mode will let a
simple statement-oriented command move out of (but never into) a
compound or group statement.  Trying hard enough means repeating the
same command enough times, which is determined by the value of the
option <code>reduce-max-escape-tries</code>, which currently has the default
value 2; <a href="Customization.html">Customization of REDUCE IDE</a>.  The
overall effect of this is to enforce a brief pause (one ineffective
command execution) that serves to prevent you from skipping out of a
compound or group statement accidentally, but without causing any
serious inconvenience.
</p>
<p>The following commands all accept a numerical argument, which defaults
to 1.  The commands to move forwards or backwards by statements do not
move in the opposite direction if given a negative argument, in which
case they do not move at all.  They contain special code to handle the
keyword <code>end</code> when it is used as the end-of-file marker and they
do not regard comment statements as statements, i.e. they treat them
as white space.  They report a user error if they fail.

<p>The following two commands move by &ldquo;balanced expression&rdquo;, which
means a symbol, string, bracketed expression, block or group.  A
symbol or bracketed expression may be quoted.  The commands skip any
preceding or intervening white space or terminator characters, but
assume point is not in a string or comment.
