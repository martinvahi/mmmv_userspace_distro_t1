     liable to be used by default it provided this option to disable its use.
     The remnants of the switch that disabled use of Xft (relating to fonts
     living on the Host or the Server) used this switch, but it now has no

     always fails abruptly, and hence working out what was wrong becomes

     CSL  to  ignore  any  startup  function  and  merely  always  begin  in  a

     can be useful to force a seed. The directive <span

     up to 64 bits taken from the values nnn and mmm. The second value
     if optional, and specifying <span

     behaviour (I hope). Note that the main Reduce-level random number

class="description"><a 
 id="dx3-2031"></a> On a typical system if the system is launched it creates a new window
     and uses its own windowed intarface in that. If it is run such that
     at startup the standard input or output are associated with a file or
     pipe, or under X the variable <span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">DISPLAY </span>is not set it will try to start
     up in console mode. The flag <span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">-w </span>indicates that the system should run
     in console more regadless, while <span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">-w+ </span>attempts a window even if that
     seems doomed to failure. When running the system to obey a script
     it will often make sense to use the <span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">-w </span>option. Note that on Windows
     the system is provided as two separate (but almost identical) binaries.
     For example the file <span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">csl.exe </span>is linked in windows mode. A result is
     that if launched from the command line it detaches from its console,

     and if launched by double-clicking it does not create a console. It is
     in fact very ugly when double clicking on an application causes an
     unwanted console window to appear. In contrast <span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">csl.com </span>is a console
     mode version of just the same program, so when launched from a
     command line it can communicate with the console in the ordinary
     expected manner.

     easier to track down low level disasters &#8211; maybe! This can be valuable
     when running under a debugger since if the code traps signals in its

     makes this happen, so when it is specified the system starts up with
     a minimal environment and only those capabilities that are present in
