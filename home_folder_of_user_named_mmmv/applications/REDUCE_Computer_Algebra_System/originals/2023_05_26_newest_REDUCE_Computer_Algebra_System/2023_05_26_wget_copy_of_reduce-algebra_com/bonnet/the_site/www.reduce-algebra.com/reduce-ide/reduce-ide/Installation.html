<span id="Installation-of-REDUCE-IDE"></span><h2 class="chapter">2 Installation of REDUCE IDE</h2>
<span id="index-Installation-of-REDUCE-IDE"></span>

<p>I recommend that you use the GNU Emacs package manager to install the
latest REDUCE IDE package as described in the
<a href="../../../reduce-algebra.sourceforge.io/reduce-ide/index.html#installation">installation section of the main REDUCE IDE web page</a>.  Alternatively,
releases as Emacs package (<code>.tar</code>) files are available from
<a href="https://github.com/fjwright/REDUCE-IDE/releases">GitHub</a> and via
the <a href="../../../reduce-algebra.sourceforge.io/reduce-ide/index.html">REDUCE
IDE home page</a>.  You can download a package file to any convenient
directory and run the Emacs command <kbd>M-x package-install-file</kbd> on
it.  For further details, <a data-manual="emacs" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Packages.html#Packages">(emacs)Packages</a>.  None of the manual
installation described below is then required.
</p>
<p>The rest of this chapter, and the related section of the chapter on
REDUCE Run mode, are for users who want to install and configure
REDUCE IDE &ldquo;by hand&rdquo;, or who want to understand the installation
process.
</p>
<p>REDUCE mode is provided by files called <samp>reduce-mode.el</samp>,
<samp>reduce-delim.el</samp> and <samp>reduce-font-lock.el</samp>, which are files
of Emacs Lisp source code.  These files should be byte-compiled, and
the compiled (<samp>.elc</samp>) files installed in a directory from which
Emacs loads its Lisp code.  If necessary, you can customize your Emacs
<code>load-path</code> so that Emacs can find the <samp>.elc</samp> files;
<a data-manual="emacs" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Customization.html#Customization">Customization</a> in <cite>The Emacs Editor</cite>.
</p>
<p>Emacs initialization and customization is stored in a file that is
normally called <samp>.emacs</samp> and lives in your home directory.  The
precise meaning of &ldquo;home directory&rdquo; depends on both your operating
system and Emacs version; the easiest way to find it in Emacs is to
visit the directory <samp>~</samp>, or just visit the file <samp>~/.emacs</samp>
directly.  Your <samp>.emacs</samp> file is updated automatically by the
Emacs customization facility and you can also edit it by hand to add
other configuration.  See <a data-manual="emacs" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Init-File.html#Init-File">Init File</a> in <cite>The Emacs Editor</cite>.
</p>
<span id="index-load_002dlibrary"></span>
<p>Before REDUCE mode can be used, the file <samp>reduce-mode.elc</samp> must
be loaded.  (It will then normally load <samp>reduce-delim.elc</samp> and
<samp>reduce-font-lock.elc</samp> automatically.)  This is necessary only
once per Emacs session.  It can be loaded explicitly, most easily by
giving the command <kbd>M-x load-library reduce-mode</kbd>.  However, you
will probably want <samp>reduce-mode.elc</samp> to be loaded automatically
the first time you (explicitly or implicitly) turn on REDUCE mode.
The way to do this is to put the following statement into your
<samp>.emacs</samp> file:
</p>
<span id="index-autoload"></span>
<div class="example lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(autoload 'reduce-mode &quot;reduce-mode&quot;
          &quot;Major mode for REDUCE code editing&quot; t)
</pre></div>

<p>This statement is completely innocuous and will have no effect unless
you select REDUCE mode.  It could therefore quite safely be put in a
system-wide configuration file (e.g. <samp>default.el</samp> or
<samp>site-start.el</samp>).  See <a data-manual="emacs" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Init-File.html#Init-File">Init File</a> in <cite>The Emacs Editor</cite>.
</p>
<p>It is also very convenient to have REDUCE mode turned on automatically
when editing a REDUCE source code file.  This can be done based on the
&ldquo;extension&rdquo; of the filename.  Provided you end all REDUCE source code
file names with the standard extension <samp>.red</samp>, the following
statement in your <samp>.emacs</samp> file will have the desired effect:
</p>
<span id="index-auto_002dmode_002dalist"></span>
<div class="example lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '(&quot;\\.red\\'&quot; . reduce-mode))
</pre></div>

<p>You can use other extensions as well or instead; if you use a different
file naming convention then make the appropriate change(s) to the above
statement.  Emacs also provides other facilities that can be used for
controlling major modes.
</p>
<p>Installation of REDUCE Run mode is documented separately; <a href="Run.html">Running REDUCE in a buffer</a>.
