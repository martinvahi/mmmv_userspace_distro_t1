<!--l. 47--><p class="noindent" >Although the programming language LISP was first formulated in 1960&#x00A0;<span class="cite">[<a 
href="slli1.html#XLISP1.5">7</a>]</span>, a
widely accepted standard has never appeared. As a result, various dialects of
LISP were produced&#x00A0;<span class="cite">[<a 
href="slli1.html#XCDC-LISP">1</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="slli1.html#XLISP/360">2</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="slli1.html#XMACLISP">6</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="slli1.html#XInterlisp">10</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="slli1.html#XLISPF1">8</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="slli1.html#XLISP1.6">9</a>]</span> in some cases several on the same
machine! Consequently, a user often faces considerable difficulty in moving
programs from one system to another. In addition, it is difficult to write and use
                                                                     

                                                                     
programs which depend on the structure of the source code such as translators,
editors and cross-reference programs.
<!--l. 57--><p class="noindent" >In 1969, a model for such a standard was produced&#x00A0;<span class="cite">[<a 
href="slli1.html#XHearn:69">4</a>]</span> as part of a general effort
to make a large LISP based algebraic manipulation program, REDUCE&#x00A0;<span class="cite">[<a 
href="slli1.html#XREDUCE3.3">5</a>]</span>, as
portable as possible. The goal of this work was to define a uniform subset of
LISP 1.5 and its variants so that programs written in this subset could run on
any reasonable LISP system.
<!--l. 64--><p class="noindent" >In the intervening years, two deficiencies in the approach taken in Ref.&#x00A0;<span class="cite">[<a 
href="slli1.html#XHearn:69">4</a>]</span> have
emerged. First in order to be as general as possible, the specific semantics and
values of several key functions were left undefined. Consequently, programs built
on this subset could not make any assumptions about the form of the values of
such functions. The second deficiency related to the proposed method of
implementation of this language. The model considered in effect two versions of
LISP on any given machine, namely Standard LISP and the LISP of
the host machine (which we shall refer to as Target LISP). This meant
that if any definition was stored in interpretive form, it would vary from
implementation to implementation, and consequently one could not write
programs in Standard LISP which needed to assume any knowledge about the
structure of such forms. This deficiency became apparent during recent
work on the development of a portable compiler for LISP&#x00A0;<span class="cite">[<a 
href="slli1.html#XPLC">3</a>]</span>. Clearly
a compiler has to know precisely the structure of its source code; we
concluded that the appropriate source was Standard LISP and not Target
LISP.
<!--l. 82--><p class="noindent" >With these thoughts in mind we decided to attempt again a definition of
Standard LISP. However, our approach this time is more aggressive. In this
document we define a standard for a reasonably large subset of LISP with as
precise as possible a statement about the semantics of each function. Secondly,
we now require that the target machine interpreter be modified or written to
support this standard, rather than mapping Standard LISP onto Target LISP as
previously.
<!--l. 90--><p class="noindent" >We have spent countless hours in discussion over many of the definitions given in
this report. We have also drawn on the help and advice of a lot of friends whose
names are given in the Acknowledgements. Wherever possible, we have used the
definition of a function as given in the LISP 1.5 Programmer&#8217;s Manual&#x00A0;<span class="cite">[<a 
href="slli1.html#XLISP1.5">7</a>]</span> and
have only deviated where we felt it desirable in the light of LISP programming
experience since that time. In particular, we have given considerable
thought to the question of variable bindings and the definition of the
                                                                     

                                                                     
evaluator functions EVAL and APPLY. We have also abandoned the
previous definition of LISP arrays in favor of the more accepted idea of a
vector which most modern LISP systems support. These are the places
where we have strayed furthest from the conventional definitions, but we
feel that the consistency which results from our approach is worth the
redefinition.
<!--l. 105--><p class="noindent" >We have avoided entirely in this report problems which arise from environment
passing, such as those represented by the FUNARG problem. We do not
necessarily exclude these considerations from our standard, but in this report
have decided to avoid the controversy which they create. The semantic differences
between compiled and interpreted functions is the topic of another paper&#x00A0;<span class="cite">[<a 
href="slli1.html#XPLC">3</a>]</span>.
Only functions which affect the compiler in a general way make reference to
it.
<!--l. 113--><p class="noindent" >This document is not intended as an introduction to LISP rather it is assumed
that the reader is already familiar with some version. The document is thus
intended as an arbiter of the syntax and semantics of Standard LISP. However,
since it is not intended as an implementation description, we deliberately
leave unspecified many of the details on which an actual implementation
depends. For example, while we assume the existence of a symbol table
for atoms (the &#8221;object list&#8221; in LISP terminology), we do not specify its
structure, since conventional LISP programming does not require this
information. Our ultimate goal, however, is to remedy this by defining
an interpreter for Standard LISP which is sufficiently complete that its
implementation on any given computer will be straightforward and precise.
At that time, we shall produce an implementation level specification
for Standard LISP which will extend the description of the primitive
functions defined herein by introducing a new set of lower level primitive
functions in which the structure of the symbol table, heap and so on may be
defined.
<!--l. 131--><p class="noindent" >The plan of this chapter is as follows. In Section&#x00A0;<a 
href="slse2.html#x3-20002">2<!--tex4ht:ref: dtypes --></a> we describe the various data
types used in Standard LISP. In Section&#x00A0;<a 
href="slse3.html#x12-100003">3<!--tex4ht:ref: slfns --></a>, a description of all Standard LISP
functions is presented, organized by type. These functions are defined
in an RLISP syntax which is easier to read than LISP S-expressions.
Section&#x00A0;<a 
href="slse4.html#x33-270004">4<!--tex4ht:ref: slglobals --></a> describes global variables which control the operation of Standard
LISP.
