                <h1>REDUCE 3.8 Documentation</h1>

<p>
    REDUCE 3.8, released in 2004, was the last commercial release of
    REDUCE before it became Open Source in 2008. This page provides
    access to the REDUCE 3.8 documentation, mainly for historical
    interest.
</p>
<p>
    One key document is the <a href="../reduce-algebra.com/docs/reduce.pdf">REDUCE
    User&apos;s Manual</a>, version 3.8.  This provides a
    comprehensive guide to the REDUCE language and the supported
    packages. A comprehensive html-based
    <a href="reduce38-docs/help/index.html">help facility</a>
    indexes essentially all capabilities of the system. A
    <a href="reduce38-docs/primer.pdf">primer</a>
    for the symbolic mode of REDUCE and the
    <a href="reduce38-docs/sl.pdf">Standard Lisp Report</a> are also
    online.  (Expand the <code>reduce38-docs</code> folder in the
    <a href="http://www.reduce-algebra.com/sitemap.php">Site Map</a> for a complete listing of
    REDUCE 3.8 documentation available here, which includes a couple
    more HTML files.)
</p>
<p>
