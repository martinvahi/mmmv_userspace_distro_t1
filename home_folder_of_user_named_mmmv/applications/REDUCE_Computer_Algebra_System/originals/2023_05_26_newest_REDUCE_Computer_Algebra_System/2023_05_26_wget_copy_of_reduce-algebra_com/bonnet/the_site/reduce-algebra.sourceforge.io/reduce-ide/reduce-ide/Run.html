<span id="index-Running-REDUCE"></span>

<p>REDUCE Run mode is a subsidiary of REDUCE mode, in the sense that it
requires REDUCE mode to be loaded before it is loaded (which it tries
to ensure automatically).  It provides an interface that allows you to
run a command-line (as opposed to a GUI) version of REDUCE
interactively in an Emacs window, with input from and output to that
window.
</p>
<p>In fact, it allows you to run multiple versions of REDUCE
simultaneously and independently in multiple windows.  By default, it
runs the distributed pre-built versions of CSL and PSL REDUCE.
</p>
<p>You can also run a REDUCE source code file or an Emacs buffer
containing REDUCE source code (in REDUCE mode) as a complete REDUCE
program in an independent window automatically named from the source
code file or buffer.
</p>
<p>REDUCE statements, procedures or general regions of code in a REDUCE
mode buffer can be sent to REDUCE running in another buffer.  If
REDUCE is running in multiple buffers then you select which buffer to
use.  If you try to send REDUCE code to REDUCE but REDUCE is not
running, then REDUCE Run mode will (optionally) start REDUCE
automatically.
