                <h1>Features</h1>

<p>
    REDUCE is a system for general algebraic computations of interest
    to mathematicians, scientists and engineers, which is normally
    used interactively. It has been produced by a collaborative effort
    involving many <a href="about.php.html#contributors">contributors</a>.
</p>
<h2>Basic features</h2>
<p>
    The basic features of REDUCE, which might be useful to students
    and teachers from high school / secondary school up to university
    level, include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>exact arithmetic using integers and fractions;</li>
    <li>arbitrary precision numerical approximation;</li>
    <li>polynomial and rational function algebra;</li>
    <li>exponential, logarithmic, trigonometric and hyperbolic functions;</li>
    <li>differentiation and integration of functions of one or more variables;</li>
    <li>factorization and expansion of polynomials and rational functions;</li>
    <li>solution of single and simultaneous equations;</li>
    <li>automatic and user controlled simplification of expressions;</li>
    <li>plotting graphs of functions in 2 and 3 dimensions;</li>
    <li>output of results in a variety of formats.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Advanced features</h2>
<p>
    More advanced features, which allow calculations at university
    level and beyond, include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>substitutions and pattern matching in a wide variety of expressions;</li>
    <li>calculations involving matrices with numerical and symbolic elements;</li>
    <li>general matrix and non-commutative algebra;</li>
    <li>solution of ordinary differential equations;</li>
    <li>powerful intuitive user-level programming language;</li>
    <li>facilities for generating optimized numerical programs from symbolic input;</li>
    <li>calculations with a wide variety of special (higher transcendental) functions;</li>
    <li>quantifier elimination and decision for interpreted first-order logic;</li>
    <li>Dirac matrix calculations of interest to high energy physicists.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Interactive and batch-mode use</h2>
<p>
    REDUCE is often used as an interactive algebraic calculator for
    problems that are possible to do by hand. However, it is <a>designed</a> to
    support calculations that are not feasible by hand. Many such
    calculations take a significant time to set up and can run for
    minutes, hours or even days on the most powerful computers. REDUCE
    supports non-interactive batch-mode use for large computations.
</p>
<h2>General design characteristics</h2>
<p>
    The REDUCE computer algebra system has been designed with the
    following general characteristics in mind:
</p>
<dl>
    <dt>Code stability</dt>
    <dd>Various versions of REDUCE have been in use since the late
        1960s. There has been a steady stream of improvements and
        refinements since then, with the source being subject to wide
        review by the user community. REDUCE has thus evolved into a
        powerful system whose critical components are highly reliable,
        stable and efficient.</dd>
    <dt>Full source code availability</dt>
    <dd>From the beginning, it has been possible to obtain the
        complete REDUCE source code, including the &quot;kernel.&quot;
        Consequently, REDUCE is a valuable educational resource and a
        good foundation for experiments in the discipline of computer
        algebra. Many users do in fact effectively modify the source
        code for their own purposes.</dd>
    <dt>Flexible updating</dt>
    <dd>One advantage of making all code accessible to the user is
        that it is relatively easy to incorporate patches to correct
        small problems or extend the applicability of existing code to
        new problem areas. World Wide Web servers (currently
        SourceForge and its mirror sites) allow users to get such
        updates and completely new packages as they become available,
        without having to wait for a formal system release.</dd>
    <dt>Portability</dt>
    <dd>Careful design for portability means REDUCE is often available
        on new or uncommon machines soon after their release. This has
        led to significant user communities throughout the world. At
        the present time, REDUCE is readily available on essentially
        all computers.</dd>
    <dt>Uniformity</dt>
    <dd>Even though REDUCE is supported with different Lisps on many
        different platforms, much attention has been paid to making
        all versions perform in the same manner regardless of
        implementation. As a result, users can have confidence that
        their calculations will not behave differently if they move
        them to a different machine.</dd>
    <dt>Algebraic focus</dt>
    <dd>REDUCE aims at being part of a complete scientific environment
        rather than being the complete environment itself. As a
        result, users can take advantage of other state-of-the-art
        systems specializing in numerical and graphical calculations,
        rather than depend on just one system to provide
        everything. To this end, REDUCE provides facilities for
        writing results in a form compatible
        <a href="manual-lookup.php%3FGENTRAN.html">with common numerical
            programming languages</a> (such as C or Fortran) or
        <a href="manual-lookup.php%3FRLFI.html">document processors</a> such
        as <span class="latex">L<sup>a</sup>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>.</dd>
    <dt>State-of-the-art algorithms</dt>
    <dd>Another advantage of an &quot;open&quot; system is that there
        is a shared development effort involving both distributors and
        users. As a result, it is easier to keep the code up-to-date,
        with the best current algorithms being used soon after their
        development. At the present time, we believe REDUCE has
        superior code for solving non-linear polynomial equations
        using
        <a href="manual-lookup.php%3FGROEBNER.html">Gr&ouml;bner bases</a>,
        real and complex
        <a href="manual-lookup.php%3FFinding&#32;Roots.html">root finding</a> to
        any precision, <a href="manual-lookup.php%3FEXCALC.html">exterior
            calculus</a> calculations and
        <a href="manual-lookup.php%3FSCOPE.html">optimized numerical code
            generation</a> among others. Its simplification strategy,
        using a combination of efficient polynomial manipulation and
        flexible pattern matching is focused on giving users as
        natural a result as possible without excessive programming.</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Specialist packages</h2>
<p>
    REDUCE has a wide user base, which has led to a wide range of
    packages for specific purposes. A particular algebra system is
    often chosen for a given calculation because of its widespread use
    in a particular application area, with existing packages and
    templates being used to speed up problem solving. As evidenced by
    approximately 1000 reports listed in the current
    <a href="bibliography.php.html">bibliography</a>, REDUCE has a large and
    dedicated user community working in just about every branch of
    computational science and engineering. A large number of special
    purpose packages are available in support of this, with many
    contributed by users.
