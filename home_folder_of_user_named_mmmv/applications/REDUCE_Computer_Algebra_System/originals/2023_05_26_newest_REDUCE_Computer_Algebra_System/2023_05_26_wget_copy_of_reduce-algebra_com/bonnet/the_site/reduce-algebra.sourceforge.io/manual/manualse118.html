<!--l. 43--><p class="noindent" >The <span 
class="pcrr8t-x-x-109">rtrace </span>package is a modiﬁcation (by FJW) of the <span 
class="pcrr8t-x-x-109">rdebug </span>package (written by
HM, and included in the <span 
class="pcrr8t-x-x-109">rtrace </span>source directory). The modiﬁcations are as follows.
The procedure-tracing facilities in <span 
class="pcrr8t-x-x-109">rdebug </span>rely upon the low-level tracing facilities in
PSL; in <span 
class="pcrr8t-x-x-109">rtrace </span>these low-level facilities have been (partly) re-implemented portably.
The names of the tracing commands that have been re-implemented portably have been
changed to avoid conﬂicting with those provided by the underlying Lisp system by
preceding them with the letter “r”, and they provide a generalized interface
that supports algebraic mode better. An additional set of rule tracing facilities
for inactive rules has been provided. Beware that the <span 
class="pcrr8t-x-x-109">rtrace </span>package is still
experimental!
</p><!--l. 56--><p class="noindent" >This package is intended to be portable, and has been tested with both CSL- and
PSL-based REDUCE. However, it is intended not as a replacement for <span 
class="pcrr8t-x-x-109">rdebug </span>but
as a partial re-implementation of <span 
class="pcrr8t-x-x-109">rdebug </span>that works with CSL-REDUCE,
and it is assumed that PSL users will continue to use <span 
class="pcrr8t-x-x-109">rdebug</span>. It should, in
principle, be possible to use both. Any <span 
class="pcrr8t-x-x-109">rtrace </span>functions with the same names as
<span 
class="pcrr8t-x-x-109">rdebug </span>functions should either be identical or compatible; <span 
class="pcrr8t-x-x-109">rtrace </span>should be
loaded after <span 
class="pcrr8t-x-x-109">rdebug </span>in order to retain any enhancements provided by <span 
class="pcrr8t-x-x-109">rtrace</span>.
Perhaps at some future time the two packages should be merged. However, note
that <span 
class="pcrr8t-x-x-109">rtrace </span>currently provides <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">only tracing </span>(hence the name) and does not
support break points. (The current version also does not support conditional
tracing.)
