<span id="index-Introduction-to-REDUCE-Run-mode"></span>

<p>REDUCE Run mode provides the following facilities for running REDUCE:
</p>
<ul>
<li> input editing and flexible re-execution of previous input;
</li><li> flexible browsing of all input and output;
</li><li> syntax highlighting of prompts, input and error messages;
</li><li> bracket and delimiter highlighting or matching as in REDUCE mode;
</li><li> easy REDUCE package loading, source file input and module compilation;
</li><li> seamless integration with source files being edited using REDUCE edit
mode, including easy input of statements, procedure definitions,
arbitrary regions or the whole file to REDUCE;
</li><li> optional automatic starting of REDUCE;
</li><li> menu access to many facilities;
</li><li> all other standard Emacs facilities, such as printing part or all of the
interaction buffer.
</li></ul>

<p>These facilities include many of those offered by other REDUCE
interfaces, with the notable exception of typeset quality display of
mathematical output.
</p>
<p>REDUCE Run mode is a subsidiary library to REDUCE mode and when loaded
it hooks itself into and cooperates closely with REDUCE mode.
</p>
<p>REDUCE Run mode is built on top of the general
command-interpreter-in-a-buffer (comint) mode and so shares a common
base functionality and a common set of key bindings with all modes
derived from comint mode.  This makes these modes easier to use.
(Among these, shell mode is likely to be the most familiar.
See <a data-manual="emacs" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Interactive-Shell.html#Interactive-Shell">Interactive Inferior Shell</a> in <cite>The
Emacs Editor</cite>.  In fact, REDUCE Run mode is based on the standard
library <samp>inf-lisp</samp> by <a href="mailto:shivers@cs.cmu.edu">Olin Shivers</a>.
See <a data-manual="emacs" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/External-Lisp.html#External-Lisp">Running an External Lisp</a> in <cite>The Emacs
Editor</cite>.)
</p>
<p>For further documentation on the functionality provided by comint mode
and the hooks available for customizing it, see the <code>comint</code>
customization group and the file <samp>comint.el</samp>.
</p>
<p>Note that, by default, in comint mode the whole interaction buffer is
editable, which applies also to REDUCE Run mode, unlike most other
REDUCE interfaces, in which previous input and output cannot be
changed.  This can be particularly disconcerting when deleting
erroneous input &ldquo;back to the prompt&rdquo; because, by default, the prompt
itself can also be deleted.  This can be prevented by customizing the
option <code>comint-prompt-read-only</code>.  The <code>comint</code>
customization group can be accessed via a link in the REDUCE Run
customization group.
