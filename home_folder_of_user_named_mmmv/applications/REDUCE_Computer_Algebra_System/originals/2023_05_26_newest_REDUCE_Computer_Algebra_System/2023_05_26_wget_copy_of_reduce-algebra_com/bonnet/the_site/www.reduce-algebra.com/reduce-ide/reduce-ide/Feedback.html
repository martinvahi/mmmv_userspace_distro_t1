<p>Feedback is welcome, including reports of errors or features that do
not work well and suggestions for improvements or additional features.
You can provide feedback in several ways:
</p>
<ul>
<li> informally using email (or a web form) via
<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/fjwcentaur/feedback">my website</a>;

</li><li> via my <a href="https://github.com/fjwright/REDUCE-IDE/issues">GitHub
issue tracker</a>, for which you must be logged in to GitHub;

</li><li> via the main <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/reduce-algebra/bugs/">REDUCE bug tracker</a>, for which you must be logged in to SourceForge.
</li></ul>

<p>If possible, please include details of the version of Emacs that you
are using, the platform on which you are using it, and the version of
REDUCE IDE that you are using.  (This information is essential if you
are reporting a bug.)  An easy way to do this is to send me the Emacs
and REDUCE IDE version strings.  You can access the former from the
standard Emacs <code>Help</code> menu and the latter from the REDUCE major
mode menus, in all cases by selecting the <code>Show Version</code> menu
option.  The version strings can also be accessed by running the
commands <kbd>M-x emacs-version</kbd> and <kbd>M-x reduce-ide-version</kbd>.
These menu options and commands will display the version string in the
echo area at the bottom of the frame; it will also be recorded in the
<code>*Messages*</code> buffer, from where it can easily be copied.
