<!--l. 10--><p class="noindent" >REDUCE is designed so that each operator in the system has an evaluation (or
simpliﬁcation)<a 
 id="dx72-119002"></a> function associated with it that transforms the expression into an internal
canonical form. <a 
 id="dx72-119003"></a>This form, which bears little resemblance to the original expression, is
described in detail in <span class="cite">[<a 
href="manualap2.html#XHearn:71a">Hea71</a>]</span>.
</p><!--l. 16--><p class="noindent" >The evaluation function may transform its arguments in one of two alternative ways.
First, it may convert the expression into other operators in the system, leaving no
functions of the original operator for further manipulation. This is in a sense
true of the evaluation functions associated with the operators <span 
class="pcrr8t-x-x-109">+</span>, <span 
class="pcrr8t-x-x-109">* </span>and <span 
class="pcrr8t-x-x-109">/ </span>, for
example, because the canonical form<a 
 id="dx72-119004"></a> does not include these operators explicitly. It
is also true of an operator such as the determinant operator <span 
class="pcrr8t-x-x-109">det</span><a 
 id="dx72-119005"></a> because the
relevant evaluation function calculates the appropriate determinant, and the
operator <span 
class="pcrr8t-x-x-109">det </span>no longer appears. On the other hand, the evaluation process may
                                                                     

                                                                     
leave some residual functions of the relevant operator. For example, with the
operator <span 
class="pcrr8t-x-x-109">cos</span>, a residual expression like <span 
class="pcrr8t-x-x-109">cos(x) </span>may remain after evaluation
unless a rule for the reduction of cosines into exponentials, for example, were
introduced. These residual functions of an operator are termed <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">kernels</span><a 
 id="dx72-119006"></a> and are stored
uniquely like variables. Subsequently, the kernel is carried through the calculation
as a variable unless transformations are introduced for the operator at a later
stage.
</p><!--l. 35--><p class="noindent" ><a 
 id="switch:INTSTR"></a> In those cases where the evaluation process leaves an operator expression with
non-trivial arguments, the form of the argument can vary depending on the state of the
system at the point of evaluation. Such arguments are normally produced in
expanded form with no terms factored or grouped in any way. For example, the
expression <span 
class="pcrr8t-x-x-109">cos(2*x+2*y) </span>will normally be returned in the same form. If the
argument <span 
class="pcrr8t-x-x-109">2*x+2*y </span>were evaluated at the top level, however, it would be printed
as <span 
class="pcrr8t-x-x-109">2*(X+Y)</span>. If it is desirable to have the arguments themselves in a similar
form, the switch <span 
class="pcrr8t-x-x-109">intstr</span><a 
 id="dx72-119007"></a><a 
 id="dx72-119008"></a><a 
 id="dx72-119009"></a> (for “internal structure”), if on, will cause this to
happen.
</p><!--l. 47--><p class="noindent" >In cases where the arguments of the kernel operators may be reordered, the system puts
them in a canonical order, based on an internal intrinsic ordering of the variables.
However, some commands allow arguments in the form of kernels, and the user has no
way of telling what internal order the system will assign to these arguments. To resolve
this diﬃculty, we introduce the notion of a <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">kernel form</span><a 
 id="dx72-119010"></a> as an expression that transforms
to a kernel on evaluation.
