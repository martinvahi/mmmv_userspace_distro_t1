<p>The command to start REDUCE is <code>run-reduce</code>.  If the option
<code>reduce-run-multiple</code> is non-nil (which by default it is) then it
starts a new REDUCE process every time it is executed; successive
REDUCE process buffers have successively higher numbers at the end of
their names, e.g. <code>*CSL REDUCE*</code>, <code>*CSL REDUCE 1*</code>,
<code>*CSL REDUCE 2*</code>, <small class="enddots">...</small>  Otherwise it only starts a new
REDUCE process if necessary &ndash; if an appropriate REDUCE process is
already running then it simply switches to it.  Finally, these
commands run the hooks from <code>reduce-run-mode-hook</code> (after the
<code>comint-mode-hook</code> is run).
</p>
<dl class="def">
<dt id="index-run_002dreduce"><span class="category">Command: </span><span><strong>run-reduce</strong><a href='Run-REDUCE.html#index-run_002dreduce' class='copiable-anchor'> &para;</a></span></dt>
<dd><p>This command prompts for the name of a REDUCE command in the
minibuffer, using completion and ignoring case.  The REDUCE command
names are as specified by the option <code>reduce-run-commands</code>.  If
you donâ€™t give a command name, i.e. you just hit <tt class="key">RET</tt>, then a
menu pops up at the current pointer location, from which you can
select the name of the command you want to run.  The REDUCE process
buffer is named using the name of the REDUCE command that it runs,
e.g. <code>*CSL REDUCE*</code> or <code>*PSL REDUCE*</code>.
</p>
<p>If this command is executed with a prefix argument then it reads an
actual command to run REDUCE from the minibuffer and runs that
command.  In this case, the REDUCE process buffer is named without any
reference to the REDUCE command, e.g. <code>*REDUCE*</code>.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>A couple of convenience commands allow you to re-start a running
REDUCE process in the same buffer and switch from any buffer to a
running REDUCE process buffer.
</p>
<dl class="def">
<dt id="index-re_002drun_002dreduce"><span class="category">Command: </span><span><strong>re-run-reduce</strong><a href='Run-REDUCE.html#index-re_002drun_002dreduce' class='copiable-anchor'> &para;</a></span></dt>
<dd><p>This command is only allowed in a REDUCE process buffer.  If REDUCE is
running in the current buffer then it is terminated.  The command then
reruns the REDUCE command whose name is shown in the buffer name.
(This will not work if you entered the actual command to run REDUCE
directly.)
</p></dd></dl>

<dl class="def">
<dt id="index-switch_002dto_002dreduce"><span class="category">Command: </span><span><strong>switch-to-reduce</strong><a href='Run-REDUCE.html#index-switch_002dto_002dreduce' class='copiable-anchor'> &para;</a></span></dt>
<dd><p>This command is primarily intended for internal use by other commands
but it can be used interactively to switch to a running REDUCE process
buffer.  If the current buffer is an active REDUCE process buffer then
the command does nothing; if there is only one active REDUCE process
buffer then the command switches to it; otherwise, the command reads
the name of an active REDUCE process buffer from the minibuffer with
completion.  This means that pressing the <tt class="key">TAB</tt> key will give a
list of active REDUCE process buffers from which to select one.  It
remembers the last buffer used and offers that as the default, making
it easy to switch repeatedly to the same REDUCE process buffer.  This
function is used by all commands described below that send REDUCE code
fragments to a running REDUCE process.
</p>
<p>If REDUCE is not running then this command will start REDUCE
automatically by calling <code>run-reduce</code> if the option
<code>reduce-run-autostart</code> is non-nil (which by default it is).
</p></dd></dl>
