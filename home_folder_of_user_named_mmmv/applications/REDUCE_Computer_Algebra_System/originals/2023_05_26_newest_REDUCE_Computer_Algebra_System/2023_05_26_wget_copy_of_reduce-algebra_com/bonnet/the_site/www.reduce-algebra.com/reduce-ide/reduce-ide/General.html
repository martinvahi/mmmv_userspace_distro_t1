<span id="index-Features"></span>

<span id="index-reduce_002dmode"></span>
<p>REDUCE mode can be selected by giving the command <kbd>M-x
reduce-mode</kbd>, although normally it will be selected automatically,
probably via the filename extension; <a href="Installation.html">Installation
of the REDUCE IDE</a>.  REDUCE mode inherits from <code>prog-mode</code> and so
shares some basic functionality common to all Emacs programming modes.
</p>
<p>The commands provided by REDUCE mode are aware of REDUCE syntax and
ignore the contents of strings and the case of characters.  Except for
the special comment commands, they also ignore comments;
<a href="Comments.html">Support for REDUCE comments</a>.  The standard GNU Emacs
indentation (see <a href="Indentation.html">Indenting REDUCE code
automatically</a>) and comment commands are supported, either via the
general Emacs mechanisms or by re-binding the standard keys to REDUCE
mode versions of standard commands.  The design of this mode is
modelled primarily on Lisp mode and the %-comment conventions
basically follow those of Lisp mode.  I have also taken some ideas
from FORTRAN mode.
</p>
<p>The standard Emacs syntax tables are modified to reflect REDUCE syntax
so that, for example, Emacs knows that the REDUCE escape character is
<code>!</code>.
</p>
<p>Blank lines separate &ldquo;paragraphs&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>Loading the REDUCE mode library runs any functions on
<code>reduce-mode-load-hook</code>, which can be used to customize global
features of REDUCE mode such as its key map.  Entry to REDUCE mode
runs any functions on <code>prog-mode-hook</code> and then any functions on
<code>reduce-mode-hook</code>, which can be used to customize buffer-local
features of REDUCE mode, e.g. to turn on font-lock mode.
See <a href="Installation.html">Installation of the REDUCE IDE</a>.
See <a href="Customization.html">Customization of REDUCE IDE</a>.
</p>
<p>REDUCE mode is intended to support both the algebraic and symbolic modes
of REDUCE.  It provides very limited support for Lisp syntax to the
extent that it is likely to be used in symbolic-mode code, and hence it
understands the significance of the quote symbol (<code>'</code>) to some
extent.  Syntax-directed editing naturally works correctly only if the
syntax of the source code being edited is correct.  If it is not then
strange things can happen, and the services of the Emacs undo facilities
may be required!
</p>

<p>A major mode menu provides convenient access to most of the major
facilities of REDUCE mode.
