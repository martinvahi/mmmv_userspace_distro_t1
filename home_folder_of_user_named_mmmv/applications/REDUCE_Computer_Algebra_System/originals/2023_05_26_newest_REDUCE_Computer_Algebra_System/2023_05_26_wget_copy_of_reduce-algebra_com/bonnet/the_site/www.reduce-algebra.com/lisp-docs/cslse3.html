     at one stage related to when small values created there got truncated

     locale but has not been activated for some while. In the fullness of

class="description"><a 
 id="dx4-3016"></a> &#x00A0;<br 
class="newline" />In CSL if the fluid variable <span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">!*lower </span>is set (which it is by default) then
     when characters are read they are folded to lower case. The related
     variable <span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">!*raise </span>causes input to be folded to upper case on input.
     In the original Standard Lisp the true internal names of all functions
     were in upper case, and <span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">!*raise </span>was used so that code using it could
     be written in mixed or lower case. At some stage it was accepted that
     upper case was a throw-back to the days of FORTRAN and punched
     cards, so the CSL switched to using lower case internally and the
     <span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">!*lower </span>flag allowed the existing Reduce sources to survive. At some
     time in the future I hope that Reduce will arrange to have both <span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">*raise</span>
     and <span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">!*lower </span>set to <span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">nil </span>so that it becomes a case-sensitive system.
     <!--l. 376--><p class="noindent" >Note that the PSL Lisp system once (but not now) used <span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">!*lower </span>to
     cause internally upper case symbols to be printed in lower case, so that
     there it is a control of output rather than input case folding. PSL has
     functions <span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">input!-case </span>and <span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">output!-case </span>that are relevant in this
     respect. So code that is to be portable between the two Lisps needs to
     take care.

class="description"><a 
 id="dx4-3017"></a> &#x00A0;<br 
class="newline" />Common Lisp would like it to be possible to specify a function that
     would be called to allow overriding of the normal method of expanding
     macros. This variable exists in CSL in case at any stage a serious need

class="newline" />An experimental additional compiler for CSL that maps Lisp directly
     onto native code for the current platform has been in development for
     some time, but it is not in a state such as to make it useful for other
     than people who wish to experiment, extend and debug it. This flag

class="description"><a 
 id="dx4-3020"></a> &#x00A0;<br 
class="newline" />The CSL compiler normally tries to detect patterns of recursion that it
     can convert into iteration. This can dramatically reduce stack use and
     so allow calculations to succeed when otherwise they would have failed.
     This flag can disable that optimisation. The most plausible reason to
     want to do that would be if there was serious cause to believe that the
     code performorming the optimisation was faulty, and results without
     it were needed as part of the process of tracking down the bug.

class="description"><a 
 id="dx4-3021"></a> &#x00A0;<br 
class="newline" />Interrnally CSL stores the table that maps names into symbols in a
     way following the style of the Common Lisp package system. When
     used as a Standard Lisp there is only one package and no distinction
     between internal and external name visibility, but this name provides
     access to the main tdata-structure involved. It is in general expected
     that this will be used via the <span

class="newline" />This variable is not actually predefined, but I will nevertheless give
     some explanation of how it is used during the bootstrapping process
     that makes a CSL or a Reduce image. When you attempt to open
     a  file  you  mau  give  a  path  starting  with  an  initial  &#8220;$word/&#x2026;&#8221;  or
     &#8220;$<span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">{</span>word<span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">}</span>/&#x2026;&#8221;.  these  notations  of  course  model  typical  Unix-style
     parameter substitution. The expansion proceeds by first checking if a
     Lisp variable &#8220;@word&#8221; exists with a string or a symbol as its name. If
     so that value is used as the expansion. If that scheme fails the system
     next looks for an environment variable and uses its value. This the use
     of a Lisp variable &#8220;@word&#8221; takes priority over the system environment.
     Finally if there is no environment variable available a Lisp variable
     with name &#8220;$word&#8221; is checked and if its value is a string or symbol
     that is the expansion, otherwise the expansion will be empty.

class="newline" />The  CSL  Lisp  system  was  designed  so  that  if  necessary  much  of
     the  code  could  be  shared  with  a  version  that  met  the  Common
     Lisp Standard. At no stage has there been anything like a complete
     Common version. This is both because the main use of CSL has been
     to  support  Reduce  and  that  wants  Standard  (not  Common)  Lisp,
     and because providing complete support for all the functionality in
     Common Lisp would be a lot of work and would tend to make the
     code bulkier (and hence necessarily less reliable) and slower. However
     various key underpinnings for Common Lisp are present in the C-coded
     sources, generally guarded by &#8220;<span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">#ifdef COMMON</span>&#8221;. If the Lisp has been
     built in this way then this variable will be set in order that users can
     readily detect the situation. At one stage the Axiom algebra system
     could be built using the limited Common Lisp compatibility mode,
     but the recent Open Source versions of Axiom have probably changed
     leaving that not an easy option.
