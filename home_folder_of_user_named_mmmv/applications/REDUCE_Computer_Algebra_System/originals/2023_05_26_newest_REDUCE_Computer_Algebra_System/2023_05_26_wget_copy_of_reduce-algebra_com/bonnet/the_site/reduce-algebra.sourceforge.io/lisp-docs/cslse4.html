<!--l. 707--><p class="noindent" >There is a global variable called <span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">lispsystem!* </span>whose value is reset in the process
of CSL starting up. An effect of this is that if the user changes its value those
changes do not survice a preserving and re-loading a heap image: this is
deliberate since the heap image may be re-loaded on a different instance of CSL
possibly on a quite different computer of with a different configuration. The value
of <span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">lispsystem!* </span>is a list of items, where each item is either an atomic tag of
a pair whose first component is a key. In general it would be unwise
to rely on exactly what information is present without review of the
code that sets it up. The information may be of interest to anybody but
some tags and keys are reflections of experiments rather than fully stable
facilities.
     <dl class="description"><dt class="description">
<span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">(c!-code . count)</span> </dt><dd 
class="description"><a 
 id="dx5-4001"></a> This will be present if code has been optimised into
     C through the source files u01.c to u60.c, and in that case the value
     tells you how many functions have been optimised in this manner.
     </dd><dt class="description">
<span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">common!-lisp</span> </dt><dd 
class="description"><a 
 id="dx5-4002"></a> For  a  project  some  while  ago  a  limited  Common  Lisp
     compatibility mode was being developed, and this tag indicated that
     it was active. In that case all entries are in upper case and the variable
     is called <span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">*FEATURES* </span>rather than <span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">lispsystem!*</span>. But note that this
     Lisp has never even aspired to be a full Common Lisp, since its author
     considers Common Lisp to have been a sad mistake that must bear
     significant responsibility for the fact that interest in Lisp has faded
     dramatically since its introduction.
     </dd><dt class="description">
<span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">(compiler!-command . command)</span> </dt><dd 
class="description"><a 
 id="dx5-4003"></a> The value associated with this key is a
     string that was used to compile the files of C code making up CSL.
     It  should  contain  directives  to  set  up  search  paths  and  predefined
     symbols. It is intended to be used in an experiment that generates
     C code synamically, uses a command based on this string to compile
     it and then dynamically links the resulting code in with the running
     system.
     </dd><dt class="description">
<span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">csl</span> </dt><dd 
class="description"><a 
 id="dx5-4004"></a> A simple tag intended to indicate that this Lisp system is CSL and
     not any other. This can of course only work properly if all other Lisp
     systems agree not to set this tag! In the context of Reduce I note that

     the PSL Lisp system sets a tag <span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">psl </span>on <span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">lispsystem!* </span>and the realistic
     use of this is to discriminate between CSL and PSL hosted copies of
     Reduce.
     </dd><dt class="description">
<span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">debug</span> </dt><dd 
class="description"><a 
 id="dx5-4005"></a> If CSL was compiled with debugging options this is present, and one
     can imagine various bits of code being more cautious or more verbose
     if it is detected.
     </dd><dt class="description">
<span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">(executable . name)</span> </dt><dd 
class="description"><a 
 id="dx5-4006"></a> The value is the fully rooted name of the executable
     file that was launched.
     </dd><dt class="description">
<span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">fox</span> </dt><dd 
class="description"><a 
 id="dx5-4007"></a> Used  to  be  present  if  the  FOX  GUI  toolkit  was  detected  and
     incorporated as part of CSL, but now probably never used!
     </dd><dt class="description">
<span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">(linker . type)</span> </dt><dd 
class="description"><a 
 id="dx5-4008"></a>     Intended       for       use       in       association
     with <span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">compiler!-command</span>, the value is <span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">win32 </span>on Windows, <span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">x86</span><span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">_64 </span>on
     64-bit Linux and other things on other systems, as detected using the
     program <span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">objtype.c</span>.
     </dd><dt class="description">
<span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">(name . name)</span> </dt><dd 
class="description"><a 
 id="dx5-4009"></a> Some  indication  of  the  platform.  For  instance  on  one
     system I use it is <span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">linux-gnu:x86</span><span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">_64 </span>and on anther it is just <span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">win32</span>.
     </dd><dt class="description">
<span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">(native . tag)</span> </dt><dd 
class="description"><a 
 id="dx5-4010"></a> One of the many experiments within CSL that were active
     at one stage but are not current involved compilation directly into
     machine code. The strong desire to ensure that image files coudl be
     used on a cross-platform basis led to saved compiled code being tagged
     with a numeric &#8220;native code tag&#8221;, and this key/value pair identified
     the value to be used on the current machine.
     </dd><dt class="description">
<span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">(opsys . operating-system)</span> </dt><dd 
class="description"><a 
 id="dx5-4011"></a>  Some   crude   indication   of   the   host
     operating system.
     </dd><dt class="description">
<span 
class="cmbxti-10x-x-109">operating system identity</span> </dt><dd 
class="description"><a 
 id="dx5-4012"></a> The name of the current operating system is
     put on the list. Exactly what form is not explicitly defined!
     </dd><dt class="description">
<span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">pipes</span> </dt><dd 
class="description"><a 
 id="dx5-4013"></a> In the earlier days of CSL there were computers where pipes were
     not supported, so this tag notes when they are present and hance the
     facility to create sub-tasks through them can be used.

     </dd><dt class="description">
<span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">record</span><span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">_get</span> </dt><dd 
class="description"><a 
 id="dx5-4014"></a> An an extension to the CSL profiling scheme it it possible
     to  compile  a  special  version  that  tracks  and  counts  each  use  of
     property-list access functions. This can be useful because there are
     ways to give special treatment to a small number of flags and a small
     number of properties. The special-case flage end up stored as a bitmap
     in the symbol-header so avoid need for property-list searching. But of
     course recording this extra information slows things down. This tag
     notes when the slow version is in use. It might be used to trigger a
     display of statistics at the end of a calculation.
     </dd><dt class="description">
<span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">reduce</span> </dt><dd 
class="description"><a 
 id="dx5-4015"></a> This is intended to report if the initial heap image is for Reduce
     rather than merely for Lisp.
     </dd><dt class="description">
<span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">(shortname . name)</span> </dt><dd 
class="description"><a 
 id="dx5-4016"></a> Gives  the  short  name  of  the  current  executable,
     without its full path.
     </dd><dt class="description">
<span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">showmath</span> </dt><dd 
class="description"><a 
 id="dx5-4017"></a> If the &#8220;showmath&#8221; capability has been compiled into CSL this
     will be present so that Lisp code can know it is reasonable to try to
     use it.
     </dd><dt class="description">
<span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">showmath1</span> </dt><dd 
class="description"><a 
 id="dx5-4018"></a> This  marks  the  fact  that  this  version  of  CSL  will  support
     the output style where flat simple text preceeds TeX output, with a
     U+0003 (end of text) marker to separate.
     </dd><dt class="description">
<span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">sixty!-four</span> </dt><dd 
class="description"><a 
 id="dx5-4019"></a> Present if the Lisp was compiled for a 64-bit computer.
     </dd><dt class="description">
<span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">termed</span> </dt><dd 
class="description"><a 
 id="dx5-4020"></a> Present if a cursor-addressable console was detected.
     </dd><dt class="description">
<span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">texmacs</span> </dt><dd 
class="description"><a 
 id="dx5-4021"></a> Present if the system was launched with the <span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">--texmacs </span>flag. The
     intent is that this should only be done when it has been launched with
     texmacs as a front-end.
     </dd><dt class="description">
<span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">(version . ver)</span> </dt><dd 
class="description"><a 
 id="dx5-4022"></a> The CSL version number.
