<span id="index-REDUCE-on-Windows"></span>
<span id="index-Running-REDUCE-on-Windows"></span>

<p>On Microsoft Windows, the REDUCE installer does not add the REDUCE
executable folder to your path, so you can run REDUCE only via
absolute pathnames, which is what the shortcuts added to the Start
menu do.  Therefore, REDUCE Run mode also uses absolute pathnames if
it can find them, which it does by looking for the installation
directory <samp>\Program Files\Reduce\</samp> in all local drives.  It uses
relative batch file names if it fails to determine the absolute
pathnames, but this will work only if you have added the REDUCE
executable folder to your path yourself.
</p>
<p>If PSL REDUCE on Windows is run directly via the standard batch file
<samp>redpsl.bat</samp> it is unable to load any packages (or modules).  The
workaround that I use is to run PSL REDUCE indirectly via a batch file
called <samp>reduce-run-redpsl.bat</samp>, which then runs
<samp>redpsl.bat</samp>.  (I don&rsquo;t understand why this works, but it does!)
When <samp>reduce-run</samp> is loaded, it attempts to create
<samp>reduce-run-redpsl.bat</samp> in the same folder as <samp>reduce-run</samp>,
and if that is successful then it automatically configures the default
value of <code>reduce-run-commands</code> to use
<samp>reduce-run-redpsl.bat</samp> to run PSL REDUCE.  Provided this all
works, PSL REDUCE should run as you would expect.  There is no problem
running CSL REDUCE via the standard batch file <samp>redcsl.bat</samp>.
</p>
<p>You can customize the values of the options
<code>reduce-run-MSWin-drives</code>,
<code>reduce-run-installation-directory</code> and
<code>reduce-run-commands</code> (see the next section) if the default
values are not correct.  For example, if REDUCE is installed on a
remote drive then make that the sole entry in
<code>reduce-run-MSWin-drives</code>.
