<!--l. 27--><p class="noindent" >This document should explain some essential technical details for symbolic
mode programming in <span 
class="cmr-10">REDUCE </span>for those who have some experience in
<span 
class="cmr-10">REDUCE </span>algebraic programming and need to write a program in symbolic
mode. For a general introduction to <span 
class="cmr-10">REDUCE </span>please consult the <span 
class="cmr-10">REDUCE</span>
User&#8217;s Manual or one of the available books, e.g.&#x00A0;&#8220;Algebraic computing
with REDUCE&#8221; by Malcolm MacCallum and Francis Wright (Oxford
Press).
                                                                     

                                                                     
<!--l. 36--><p class="indent" >   This text cannot be complete, as the set of facilities available in <span 
class="cmr-10">REDUCE </span>is
so rich that it would take years to describe all and months to read and
understand such text. So a good policy for entering the business of symbolic
mode programming is to study the source files - the liberal <span 
class="cmr-10">REDUCE </span>distribution
policy simplifies this - and to understand those parts which contribute to the field
which one would like to use. This text tries to collect in one place some of the
wide spread basic information in order to facilitate your walk through the
<span 
class="cmr-10">REDUCE </span>mountains.
<!--l. 47--><p class="indent" >   When should you write a program in symbolic mode? Symbolic programs
are not <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">a priori </span>better than algebraic programs - the essential thing is
the mathematics which they implement. A common prejudice is that
symbolic programs are more &#8220;efficient&#8221;. This is true only if you can save in
symbolic mode substantial algebraic evaluation steps. As long as most of the
computing time is needed for a few big calculations steps (integrals, equation
solving, polynomial gcd etc.) you will gain nothing when calling the same
procedures from symbolic mode. However, if you need structures which
are not present in algebraic mode or if you can design an evaluation
avoiding lots of conversions, the step to symbolic mode programming is
justified.
<!--l. 62--><p class="indent" >   As it is very difficult to design non trivial but short examples for symbolic
mathematical programming no attempt has been made in that direction. The
examples in this text all are silly - please look at the sources of <span 
class="cmr-10">REDUCE </span>for
meaningful material. The following pieces of the sources are good points for first
reading as they provide a substantial functionality within a few pages of
code:

<!--l. 86--><p class="indent" >   For symbolic mode programming you will urgently need the <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">Standard LISP</span>
<span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">Report </span>which describes the basic LISP functions; these will be available
under all <span 
class="cmr-10">REDUCE </span>implementations and they guarantee an optimum of
portability. However, in the course of the years <span 
class="cmr-10">REDUCE </span>has imported some
additional functions on the LISP level &#8211; they have been implemented on
top of Standard LISP and live in the module <span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">support</span><a 
 id="dx2-1011"></a> of the package
<span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">rlisp.red</span>. In order to prevent the reinvention of the wheel these functions
are described in the appendix as an extension to the <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">Standard LISP</span>
<span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">Report</span>.
<!--l. 99--><p class="indent" >   The description is based on the recent version of REDUCE. Some of the
described features are not available in earlier versions.
