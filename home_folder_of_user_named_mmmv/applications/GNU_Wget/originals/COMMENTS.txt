    Wget2 is the successor of GNU Wget, a file and recursive
    website downloader.
    
    Designed and written from scratch it wraps around libwget,
    that provides the basic functions needed by a web client.
    
    Wget2 works multi-threaded and uses "modern" features to
    allow fast operation.
    
    In many cases Wget2 downloads much faster than Wget due
    to HTTP2, HTTP compression, parallel connections, use of
    If-Modified-Since HTTP header and more.
    
    Wget2 has several new command-line options, see the wiki
    page for a list and comparison with Wget.
    
    Wget will be maintained further. The idea is that breaking
    changes and new functionalities go into Wget2 / libwget.
    
    Except for WARC and FTP, Wget2 is a drop-in replacement
    for Wget in most cases. Of course there may be subtle
    differences, so make sure to test well before replacing Wget
    by Wget2.
