As of 2025 the Logisim program is de facto usable only on x86/AMD64
computers and on virtual appliances, because its souce requires Java5
for compilation and as of 2025 nobody bothers to maintain a Java5
compiler. The

    ./upstream_binary/logisim-generic-2.7.1.jar

does run with Java8 by executing

    java -jar ./upstream_binary/logisim-generic-2.7.1.jar
