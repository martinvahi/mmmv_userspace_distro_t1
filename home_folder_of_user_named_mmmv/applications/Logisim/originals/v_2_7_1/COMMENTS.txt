As of 2025 the Logisim program is de facto usable only on x86/AMD64
computers and on virtual appliances, because its souce requires Java5
for compilation and as of 2025 nobody bothers to maintain a Java5
compiler. The

    ./upstream_binary/logisim-generic-2.7.1.jar

does run with Java8 by executing

    java -jar ./upstream_binary/logisim-generic-2.7.1.jar

As of 2025_11_01 the Microsoft Bing chatbot claims that for some
Java_5 projects something in the style of 

    javac -source 1.5 -target 1.5 MyClass.java

MIGHT work with at least some Java_8 compilers and in the case
of the Maven build system the following MIGHT be helpful

    <properties>
      <maven.compiler.source>1.5</maven.compiler.source>
      <maven.compiler.target>1.5</maven.compiler.target>
    </properties>
